# libigl-course
Material for the short course on libigl. The course is composed of two parts. An overview of the coding style and purposed of the library (available in the [pptx slides](https://github.com/libigl/libigl-course/raw/master/libigl-course-slides.pptx.zip) in this repo), plus a live tutorial session.

## Part 1: libigl overview

* 1.1 [How to clone the repository](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/tutorial.html#chapter1:introductiontolibigl)

* 1.2 [Structure of libigl](https://github.com/libigl/libigl)

* 1.3 [Tutorial Compilation](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/tutorial.html#chapter1:introductiontolibigl)

* 1.4 [Structure of a simple libigl application (Tutorial 102)](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/tutorial.html#visualizingsurfaces)
* 1.5 [Overview of Discrete Geometric Quantities and Operators (202,203,204,205)](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/tutorial.html#chapter2:discretegeometricquantitiesandoperators)
* 1.6 [Overview of Shape Deformation (401,403,404,405)](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/tutorial.html#chapter4:shapedeformation)
* 1.7 [Overview of Mesh Parametrization (501,502,503,505,710)](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/tutorial.html#chapter5:parametrization)

## Part 2: How to use libigl as a header-only library

Libigl can be used as a header-only library, you can find an example of a simple application that computes mesh statistics in src/main_solution.cpp.

## Part 3: How to use libigl with libigl-example-project

The recommended way to use libigl is by using the [libigl-example-project](https://github.com/libigl/libigl-example-project) repository. 

## Part 4: Advanced features

* 4.1 [Serialization](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/#state-serialization)
* 4.2 [Booleans](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/#boolean-operations-on-meshes)
* 4.3 [Python](https://github.com/libigl/libigl/tree/master/python)

## Part 5: Coding Tips

This is a short list of coding tips that will greatly reduce your pain and suffering before (and after) the SIGGRAPH deadline.
